# Exam Monitoring Platform
 
> An examination platform for managing courses, assignments,
> examinations, automated assessment, and examination monitoring.

The **Exam Monitoring Platform** is a web-based examination system designed to
provide teachers and students with a centralized environment for
creating and managing courses, assignments, and exams.

The platform also provides examination monitoring capabilities,
including window focus/blur monitoring, camera and face monitoring,
gaze-related monitoring, and fraud-event reporting. Teachers can review
student submissions, examination results, and historical monitoring
events through dedicated reporting pages.

The original project plan included AI-based automatic grading of Moodle-style questions, but this feature was not implemented due to time constraints.

### My Contributions
During the project, I focused on the monitoring pipeline and the student‑side alert experience. My work centered on implementing MediaPipe-based detection, integrating alert logic, and providing basic UI feedback for monitoring events. I also participated in the early planning phase of the project, helping shape the initial direction and structure together with the team.

- **MediaPipe-based monitoring pipeline**  
Implemented face detection, head‑pose estimation and gaze direction using MediaPipe Face Landmarker with real-time alerts.

- **Camera readiness & alert system**  
Built the logic for camera availability checks, camera-blocking detection, no-face, multiple-faces, and real-time UI alerts for students.

- **Gaze calibration workflow**  
Implemented the gaze calibration process to improve monitoring accuracy.

- **Gaze and pose alert logic**  
Created the logic that determines suspicious gaze or head‑pose events and produces alert objects for the UI and backend.

- **Connecting alerts to backend endpoints**
Integrated the monitoring alerts with the existing backend API so that events could be logged in Supabase.

- **Basic UI for monitoring alerts**
Added simple UI components to display real-time alerts to students during monitoring (e.g., AlertPanel, alert messages, color states)

- **Monitoring UI wireframes**  
Contributed to early wireframes and layout ideas for the student monitoring interface.

- **Early project planning**  
Participated in the initial architecture and feature planning during the first weeks of the project, helping define the monitoring concept, data flow, and overall direction before implementation began.

- **Backlog management & documentation**  
Maintained weekly progress documentation and assisted with backlog organization throughout the project

###  Reporting

The platform provides separate reporting areas for teachers.

## Assignment Report

The Assignment Report provides:

- Course selection
- Assignment selection
- Submission-status filtering
- Total students
- Total assignments
- Submitted assignments
- Missing submissions
- Student submission summary
- Detailed assignment submission information
- Student scores
- Submission dates

The detailed report allows teachers to see individual assignment records
and whether each student has submitted the assignment.

---

## Exam Report

The Exam Report provides teachers with an overview of examination
 performance, including:

- Course selection
- Exam selection
- Submission-status filtering
- Total students
- Total exams
- Submitted examinations
- Missing submissions
- Student examination summary
- Detailed examination results
- Scores and submission information


---

## Fraud Report

The Fraud Report provides a historical overview of examination
monitoring events.

## Filters

Teachers can filter the report by:

- Course
- Student
- Event Type
- Risk Level


## Summary

The report provides summary information such as:

- Total students
- Total fraud/monitoring events
- High-risk events
- Average confidence



##  Student Fraud Summary

Teachers can see the number of recorded monitoring events for each
student, including their email address and risk-level event counts.

The summary helps teachers quickly identify students with a higher
number of suspicious monitoring events.


## Detailed Fraud Report

The detailed report displays:

- Student
- Student email
- Event type
- Risk level
- Event date and time
- Event details

A **View** button can be used to inspect the JSON details associated
 with an individual event.

**Note:** Fraud-event risk levels are assigned according to the
 project's monitoring-event classification.

## AI and Monitoring

This part of the system handles everything related to the webcam: face detection, camera readiness, calibration, and the prototype gaze alerts. It all runs in the browser using MediaPipe Face Landmarker.

---

## Face & Camera Monitoring

The basic monitoring runs all the time and checks that the camera is working and the student is actually visible. It can detect things like:

- **no_face**
- **multiple_faces**   
- **camera_off**
- **camera_blocked**

These alerts form the base layer of the monitoring system.

---

## Readiness Check

Before an exam session begins, the system performs a camera readiness check:

- camera is working  
- face is visible 
- lighting is acceptable  
- no multiple faces   
- frame is stable (no freezing)  

If readiness fails, the exam does not start.

---

## Gaze Calibration

The system includes individualized gaze calibration for each student.  
During calibration, the system records baseline head‑pose values for

- **CENTER**  
- **LEFT**  
- **RIGHT**  
- **UP**  
- **DOWN**

These baseline values help adjust for different webcams, seating positions, and lighting.

---

## Gaze Features

The gaze logic uses head‑pose values (yaw/pitch) and other signals from Face Landmarker.
It computes:
 
- dx/dy direction values  
- smoothed gaze vectors  
- eye openness and direction  
- classification into **left**, **right**, **up**, **down**, **center**

These features are used by both calibration and gaze alerts.

---

## Gaze Alerts (Prototype)

The system has a prototype for detecting when a student is looking away from the screen.
It can detect:

- looking away left
- looking away right
- looking away up

Clear head‑turn events work reliably.
Borderline cases (like looking at the edge of the screen) are still unstable and would need more development time. Eyes covered and a keyboard-safe zone were considered, but not implemented in this prototype

---

## Examination Monitoring Events

All monitoring events are logged to Supabase in the `Fraud_Events` table.

Examples include:

- **window_blur**  
- **window_focus**  
- **camera_ready**  
- **camera_blocked**  
- **camera_off**  
- **camera_not_ready**  
- **no_face**  
- **multiple_faces**  
- **gaze_looking_away (direction)**  
- **calibration_ready**  

---

## Architecture Overview

The monitoring system is built in layers:

**FaceLandmarker → readiness check → camera alerts → calibration → gaze features → gaze alerts → logging → UI pages**

### Folder Structure

- **src/landmarker/alerts/** – camera alerts  
- **src/landmarker/analysis/** – readiness & camera quality  
- **src/gaze/** – gaze feature extraction  
- **src/gazeAlerts/** – gaze alert logic  
- **src/hooks/** – pipeline connecting all layers  
- **src/components/** – UI pages 
- **src/pages/** – testing pages  
- **src/utils/** – drawing & Supabase logging

`src/hooks` is the center of the pipeline. It:

- starts the webcam  
- runs FaceLandmarker  
- sends raw data to readiness & alerts  
- computes gaze features  
- runs calibration  
- runs gaze alerts  
- logs events  
- provides UI‑ready data to components

---
## Fraud Risk Classification

The Fraud Report groups monitoring events into risk levels to make the
 report easier for teachers to interpret.

The classification is based primarily on **event type**.

       ├── Medium Risk
